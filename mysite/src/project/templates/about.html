		<p>Social media, crowd-sourcing, big data, and the fabled <em>Internet of Things</em> are taking an increasingly prominent role in discussions about how people use technology in their daily lives. These terms, however in vogue, only mean as much as the applications that embody them. The central idea, though, is that as we become more connected, have more information, and continue to develop and leverage machine learning techniques, we can enrich our lives and learn more about the world around us. Perhaps no aspect of the world is so ubiquitous in the human experience as the weather. From agricultural yields and natural disasters to smalltalk with strangers, the weather is everywhere. Our project will be a web page that brings together professionals, researchers, enthusiasts, and the public at large to learn about what the weather is like now, what it has been like, and maybe help us divine what it will be like tomorrow. Harnessing weather stations professional and amateur alike WhatItWas provides a repository for meteorological data. A chorus of small, connected weather gatherers will allow WhatItWas to provide weather data at a resolution and scale previously unheard of.</p>
